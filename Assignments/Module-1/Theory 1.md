#  			**Introduction to Python**



1. **Introduction to Python and its Features (simple, high-level, interpreted language).**



   Python is an interpreted , object oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics

    	Python is know for its simple and readable syntax. It was created in 1991 by Guido Van Rossum to making programming easy to learn and use

    	**Features of Python:**

   &nbsp;	\*\*Simple and Readable:\*\* Python is very simple high level language that is easy to read and write. Python uses English like syntax. In python there no need for extra {} or ; 				     and it uses very few keywords and syntaxes
   

    		**Highly Portable:** Python runs almost everywhere, from high-end servers, machines and workstations to Windows. Python is a machine independent language.

    		**Extensive:** Python is designed to be extensive using C,C++. Python itself has many libraries but it also has access to many external libraries

    		**Interpreted Language:** Python code is executed line by line. No separate compilation step is required. Errors are shown immediately, making debugging easier.

    		**High-Level Language:** Python handles memory management automatically. Programmers do not need to worry about hardware details.

   

   **2.** **History and Evolution of Python:** Python was created by Guido van Rossum. Development started in the late 1980s at CWI (Netherlands). Python was officially released in 1991.

    	**Major Versions of Python:**

    				  **Python 1.x (1991):** Basic features like lists, strings, and functions.

    				  **Python 2.x (2000):** Introduced list comprehensions and garbage collection. Widely used but officially discontinued in 2020.

    				  **Python 3.x (2008 – Present):** Improved performance and Unicode support. Removed many inconsistencies of Python 2. Python 3 is the current 							       and recommended version.

   

   **3. Advantages of Using Python over other languages:
   Easy to Learn and Use**: Ideal for beginners compared to C, C++, or Java.

    	Faster Development: Fewer lines of code compared to other languages. Saves time and increases productivity.

    	Large Community Support: Huge online community and documentation. Easy to find solutions and libraries.

    	Versatile Applications: Web development (Django, Flask), Data Science and AI (NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow), Automation and scripting, 										 Game development and desktop applications

    	Open Source and Free: Python is free to use and distribute.

    	**Integration Capabilities:** Can be integrated with C, C++, Java, and other languages.

   

   **4.** **Installing Python and setting up the development environment (Anaconda, PyCharm, or VS Code):**
